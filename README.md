Service Worker Functionality
Your service worker enables several native behaviors:
1. Caching for Offline Support
The service worker uses Workbox's caching strategies to cache your app's resources:
NetworkFirst: Tries network first, falls back to cache (used for API calls)
StaleWhileRevalidate: Uses cache immediately while updating cache in background
CacheFirst: Uses cache first, only goes to network if needed
2. Push Notifications
As seen in your actions.ts and page.tsx, your app implements push notifications:
The service worker listens for push events
When a notification is received, it displays it using the browser's notification API
Your PushNotificationManager component handles subscription
The flow works like this:
User subscribes to notifications
Subscription is saved (currently in memory, ideally in a database)
Server sends notification using web-push library
Service worker receives the push event and displays notification
3. Vibration
Vibration is typically included in the push notification options:
const options = {
  // ... other options
  vibrate: [100, 50, 100], // vibration pattern in milliseconds
  // ...
};
Relation to actions.ts
The actions.ts file contains server actions that interact with the service worker:
subscribeUser: Stores the PushSubscription from the client
unsubscribeUser: Removes the subscription
sendNotification: Uses web-push to send a notification to the subscribed client
These server actions don't directly modify the service worker but work with it through the Web Push protocol:
When sendNotification is called, it sends a message to the push service
The push service delivers it to the client's service worker
The service worker receives a push event and displays the notification
